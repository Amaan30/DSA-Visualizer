# DSA Visualizer

An interactive data structures and algorithms visualization tool built with Python, PySide6, and Matplotlib.

## Overview

DSA Visualizer is an educational application designed to help students and developers understand the inner workings of common data structures and algorithms through dynamic visualizations. By animating operations and highlighting execution steps, this tool makes abstract computer science concepts tangible and easier to grasp.

## Features

- **Array Visualizations**: Watch sorting algorithms in action with color-coded animations that illustrate each comparison, swap, and operation
- **Step-by-Step Execution**: Control the pace of algorithm execution with options to step forward, step backward, or run automatically
- **Algorithm Comparison**: Compare different algorithms side-by-side to understand their efficiency and behavior
- **Interactive Interface**: Built with PySide6 for a responsive and modern UI experience
- **Performance Metrics**: See real-time analysis of time complexity and operation counts

## Currently Implemented
- Array-based data structures
- Sorting algorithms (Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Selection Sort, etc.)

## Coming Soon
- Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues visualizations
- Tree and Graph data structures
- Pathfinding algorithms
- Search algorithms

## Technology Stack
- Python 3.x
- PySide6 for UI
- Matplotlib for advanced visualizations
- Custom animation framework

## Educational Purpose
This project aims to serve as both a learning tool and a teaching aid for computer science education. Visualizations are accompanied by explanations of the algorithm's principles and complexity analysis.

## Contributions
Contributions are welcome! Whether you want to add new algorithms, improve visualizations, or enhance the UI, please see the contribution guidelines.
